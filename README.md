Simulate the 1D Two-Stream Instability

Code calculates the motions of electrons under the Poisson-Maxwell equation
using the Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method

#### How to run
First, ensure you have the prereq packages installed, then run the Python script:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python pic.py
```
